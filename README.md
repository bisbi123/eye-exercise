# Eye Exercise
A simple exercise as part of MIT's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.
This exercise was intended to get us comfortable with CSS styles and updating the DOM programmatically.

# To Run
Simply drop the index.html file on your favorite browser and look around. You'll notice the eye colors change every time you click on the actual eye-ball.

# Future Development
I would like to add constant random color generator every time to the mouse moves. Perhaps something to look at down the road.
